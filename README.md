# Visual Leak Detector (Support Visual Studio 2022)

## Introduction

Visual C++ provides built-in memory leak detection, but its capabilities are minimal at best. This memory leak detector was created as a free alternative to the built-in memory leak detector provided with Visual C++. Here are some of Visual Leak Detector's features, none of which exist in the built-in detector:

*   Provides a complete stack trace for each leaked block, including source file and line number information when available.
*   Detects most, if not all, types of in-process memory leaks including COM-based leaks, and pure Win32 heap-based leaks.
*   Selected modules (DLLs or even the main EXE) can be excluded from leak detection.
*   Provides complete data dumps (in hex and ASCII) of leaked blocks.
*   Customizable memory leak report: can be saved to a file or sent to the debugger and can include a variable level of detail.

Other after-market leak detectors for Visual C++ are already available. But most of the really popular ones, like Purify and BoundsChecker, are very expensive. A few free alternatives exist, but they're often too intrusive, restrictive, or unreliable. Visual Leak Detector is currently the only freely available memory leak detector for Visual C++ that provides all of the above professional-level features packaged neatly in an easy-to-use library.
